When surveying existing conditions, special attention will be paid to current building loads, layouts, and resulting possible changes in power requirements.2. The existing chilling plant is composed of one chiller installed in approximately 1982, while one other large chiller and one small chiller are not functional. Mechanical equipment and distribution system was designed and specified as per requirement of more than 30 years ago. The centralized cooling equipment (chillers) located in Building L serve 5 other buildings – Buildings M, R, S, T & G (other buildings on site either have their own air conditioning system or use window units).3. In future phase, the Main Hall/Building C Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art and Building B-SIM Natural Sciences Collection which presently do not have any central air- conditioning system will be connected to the central cooling plant. Building C and Building B along with other buildings (M, R, S, T & G) must be taken into consideration while designing the chillers and calculating the total load.4. The Snug Harbor campus will remain operational during construction therefore a detailedconstruction scheduling will be considered as high priority. The project is anticipated to be constructed in two (2) phases:• Phase 1 – Replacement of main chiller for cooling system located at Building L, and study/assessment of HVAC (steam and chilled water) pipe distribution system connecting from Building L to all served buildings.• Phase II – Replacement of all HVAC (cold and steam pipes) distribution system connecting from Building L to all served buildings.

Replacement would restore the outfall’s necessary functions and avoid a potential full collapse and failure. Specifically, the proposed project includes the following: Installation of a new a 14-foot 7-inch-wide by 8-foot-high combined sewer outfall (referenced as the Bowery Bay [BB]-005 outfall) which discharges into Bowery Bay, thereby replacing the currently collapsed outfall. The proposed outfall would be reconstructed at the same location as the existing outfall and within an existing sewer easement across land that is owned by the City of New York and under the jurisdiction of the Department of Small Business Services. The proposed sewer and outfall design calls for a reinforced concrete structure supported on a concrete cradle with a flap gate at the outlet to control any inflow of tidal water from the bay. Additionally, boulders are proposed to be installed to stabilize the bottom of the bay to minimize the potential for scour and resuspension of sediments into the water column that may otherwise occur when there is flow from the outfall.

Associated work includes but is not limited to wiring, electrical work, duct work and plumbing to complete the installation of the new equipment. New plate frame heat exchanger/s will be installed to protect the downstream AHUs from geothermal groundwater. Integrate the new units to the existing BCM system. An existing cooling tower will be rehabilitated and put into service. Extensive mechanical piping for the entire project is required, mainly in the mechanical rooms, although a 4” pipe loop around the exterior of the building is proposed. A new solar-heat-gain shading device is included in scope to reduce base building heat in areas with single-glazed windows. Associated architectural, structural, electrical, and plumbing work, as required. It is also to meet DCAS ACE program criteria. Temporary cooling will be needed to keep the facility operation during construction.",Pre-Design,,,,,,,,,,Brooklyn,Brooklyn 01,"PU-0025, PV-0262, PV-0467, PV-D262, PV-K262",ESSENTIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES,02/16/2024,10/23/2023

When surveying existing conditions, special attention will be paid to current building loads, layouts, and resulting possible changes in power requirements.2. The existing chilling plant is composed of one chiller installed in approximately 1982, while one other large chiller and one small chiller are not functional. Mechanical equipment and distribution system was designed and specified as per requirement of more than 30 years ago. The centralized cooling equipment (chillers) located in Building L serve 5 other buildings – Buildings M, R, S, T & G (other buildings on site either have their own air conditioning system or use window units).3. In future phase, the Main Hall/Building C Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art and Building B-SIM Natural Sciences Collection which presently do not have any central air- conditioning system will be connected to the central cooling plant. Building C and Building B along with other buildings (M, R, S, T & G) must be taken into consideration while designing the chillers and calculating the total load.4. The Snug Harbor campus will remain operational during construction therefore a detailedconstruction scheduling will be considered as high priority. The project is anticipated to be constructed in two (2) phases:• Phase 1 – Replacement of main chiller for cooling system located at Building L, and study/assessment of HVAC (steam and chilled water) pipe distribution system connecting from Building L to all served buildings.• Phase II – Replacement of all HVAC (cold and steam pipes) distribution system connecting from Building L to all served buildings.

Replacement would restore the outfall’s necessary functions and avoid a potential full collapse and failure. Specifically, the proposed project includes the following: Installation of a new a 14-foot 7-inch-wide by 8-foot-high combined sewer outfall (referenced as the Bowery Bay [BB]-005 outfall) which discharges into Bowery Bay, thereby replacing the currently collapsed outfall. The proposed outfall would be reconstructed at the same location as the existing outfall and within an existing sewer easement across land that is owned by the City of New York and under the jurisdiction of the Department of Small Business Services. The proposed sewer and outfall design calls for a reinforced concrete structure supported on a concrete cradle with a flap gate at the outlet to control any inflow of tidal water from the bay. Additionally, boulders are proposed to be installed to stabilize the bottom of the bay to minimize the potential for scour and resuspension of sediments into the water column that may otherwise occur when there is flow from the outfall.

The typical bridge section consists of a composite concrete deck and steel superstructure supported on a reinforced concrete substructure on concrete piles. The new bridge will be constructed on a new alignment set on the north side of the existing bridge, partially overlapping with the existing bridge. The new bridge and approach roadways will provide three (3) 12 foot wide lanes for vehicular traffic, a 12 foot wide right shoulder on the bridge and a 10 foot wide right shoulder on the approach roadways, a minimum 4 foot wide left shoulder in each direction, and a 12 foot wide bicycle / pedestrian facility adjacent to the eastbound roadway.
